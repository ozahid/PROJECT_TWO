<section id="about">
<p>Hi! I am Osman N Zahid. I was born in Pakistan and raised here in Chicago.Currently studying at Illinois Institute of Technology,
 majoring in Information Technology and Management.
I just got accepted for the co-terminal program which will allow me to take Bachelors level and Masters level courses simultaneously, 
it will save me one year. My major for masters degree is Cyber Forensics and Security.</p>

<p>I was first majoring in Electrical engineering and was hoping to join U of I from Oakton community 
college as a transfer student. While taking courses at Oakton Community college I had to take python programming language in order
to fulfil the transfer courses required at U of I for electrical engineering, taking that one course made me change my major. After 
taking that course I totally felt in love with programming and after some research to see what are my options to major in I came across 
with the program in which I am cunrentlly enrolled in and not regretting a bit after joining this program at IIT.</p>

<p>Besdies studying I enjoy spending time with my family, traveling, and be involoved in outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, fishing, etc...
I am one big animal lover, I have had many pets in my life such as, birds, reptiles, and dogs. I hope and plan on to build my own little
animal kingdom in near future if time and life allows.</p>
